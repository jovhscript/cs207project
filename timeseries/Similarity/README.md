This folder holds all the code necessary for finding similiar timeseries

File Description:
   1. BinarySearchDatabase.py: From lab 10, with the addition of 3 methods (an in-order traversal, a find nodes greater than key    function and a find nodes less than key function)
   
   2. distances.py: where the kernel coefficient, tsmaker, and distance function live. The "distance" between timeseries is 2(1-kernel_coeff)

   3. find_most_similar.py: finds the n most similar time series, command line program

   4. generate_time_series.py: generates 1000 random time series and names then 'Timeseries0' through 'Timeseries999'

   5. pick_vantage_points.py: picks vantage points and creates databases, names them "____.dbdb" where the blank is the number timeseries they are (0-999)

   6. Tests folder 
    -test_database.py: some tests for the database functions I added
    -test_similarity: some tests for the similarity functions. Note that I included my sanity_check function which checks the answers using a pure brute force method.

   7. Data folders
    -GeneratedTimeseries: holds the timeseries generated by generate_time_series.py
    -VantagePointDatabases: holds the vantage point databases created by pick_vantage_points.py and contains file 'vp' which stores the numbers of the vantage points

    
Order in which to call files:
   1. generate_time_series.py: takes no arguments

   2. pick_vantage_points.py: takes an argument for number of vantage points to produce, i.e. to create 20 vantage points:
     Example: >> pick_vantage_points.py --n 20
     'n' is 20 by default if not supplied by the user
     
   3. find_most_similar.py takes in arguments:
     timeseries: mandatory name of timeseries to find similiar results to, Must be valid filename or returns error message
     --n : optional integer of similiar timeseries to find, default is 1. Must be > 0 and < number of vantage points or returns error message
     --save : optional boolean of whether to save the timeseries results in pickle format, default is False
     --savefolder : optional string of what folder to save the results in (if save == TRUE), default is 'SimilaritySearchResults'
     
     Example: >> find_most_similar.py Timeseries1 --n 20 --save TRUE --savefolder 'AnswerTS'
